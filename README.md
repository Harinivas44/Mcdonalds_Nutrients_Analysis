# McDonald's Nutrients Analysis üçîüçüü•§

# Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing the nutritional content of various McDonald's menu items. Using data collected from McDonald's menu, we delve into the essential nutrients and provide insights for making healthier food choices.

The dataset used for this analysis contains information on a variety of menu items, including their category, serving size, and nutritional content. We have considered attributes such as calories, calories from fat, cholesterol, sodium, carbohydrates, dietary fiber, sugars, and protein.
